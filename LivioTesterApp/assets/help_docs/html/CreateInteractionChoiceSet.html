<h1>Create Interaction Choice Set</h1>

The Create Interaction Choice Set command allows developers to display a pop-up list of options for the user to select from on the head-unit.  Interaction choice 
sets are created by creating the list of choices for the user to select from.  To display the interaction choice set, developers can utilize the <a href="PerformInteraction.html">PerformInteraction</a>
 command.

<p>
A choice can contain 3 parameters:

<p>
<h2>Choice Name (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
The choice name represents the text to display within the body of this choice on the pop-up list.  This text should be a short description of what this button will do when clicked. 

<p>
<h2>Voice Recognition Keyword(s) (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Comma-separated String</h3>
</br>
The voice recognition keyword input tells the vehicle what keywords are linked to this particular choice when spoken through the vehicle's voice system.

<p>
<h2>Image (optional)</h2>
<h3>Type: Image</h3>
</br>
The image for a particular choice represents an image to be displayed alongside the choice name within the body of this choice on the pop-up menu.  Images must have been added to the system 
through the <a href="PutFile.html">PutFile</a> command before they can be referenced for a choice.
