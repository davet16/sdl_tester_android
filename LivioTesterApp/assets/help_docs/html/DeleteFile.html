<h1>Delete File</h1>

The DeleteFile command allows developers to remove files that have been added to the system through the <a href="PutFile.html">PutFile</a> command.

<p>
In order to delete a file that has been added to the system, you simply need to supply 1 parameter:

<p>
<h2>File Name (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
The file name for a file that has been added to the system is used whenever the application needs to reference that particular file.
