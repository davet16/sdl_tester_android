<h1>Speak</h1>

The Speak command allows developers to prompt the vehicle's text-to-speech engine to speak text or phonemes to the head-unit.

<p>
In order to speak to the driver from your application, the following parameters are needed:

<p>
<h2>Text to Speak (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: String</h3>
</br>
This string represents the text (or phonemes) that should be spoken to the driver.

<p>
<h2>Speech Capability (required)</h2>
<h3>Type: Enumerated Value</h3>
</br>
This string represents the text (or phonemes) that should be spoken to the driver.
<p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> If the speech capability is SILENCE, the input text will represent the number of milliseconds the TTS engine should remain silent.
